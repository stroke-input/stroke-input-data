# stroke-input-data

Data sets for the [Stroke Input Method (筆畫輸入法)] in Chinese.

(For when I get around to writing a Stroke Input Method app some day.)


## Stroke Input Method

The stroke input method is found on all dumbphones in HK and surrounds.

It is the simplest Chinese input method in existence.
All strokes are classified into 5 types, entered via keypad:

| \# | Stroke | Type | Comment |
| -: | :-: | - | - |
| 1 | ㇐ | 橫 Horizontal | Includes rises (提) etc. |
| 2 | ㇑ | 豎 Vertical | |
| 3 | ㇒ | 撇 Throw | |
| 4 | ㇔ | 點 Dot | Includes presses (捺) |
| 5 | ㇖ | 折 Break | Basically everything else |
